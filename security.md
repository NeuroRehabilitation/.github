# Security

The Neuro Rehabilitation Lab takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/NeuroRehabilitation).

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of The NeuroRehabilitaiton Lab owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to `harry.vasanth[@]arditi.pt`.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Policy

To encourage research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities, we will not pursue civil or criminal action or send notice to law enforcement for accidental or good faith violations of this policy. We consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities conducted consistent with this policy to be “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the DMCA, and other applicable computer use laws such as Cal. Penal Code 502(c). We waive any potential DMCA claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in this policy's scope.

Please understand that if your security research involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of a third party (which is not us), we cannot bind that third party, and they may pursue legal action or law enforcement notice. We cannot and do not authorize security research in the name of other entities, and cannot in any way offer to defend, indemnify, or otherwise protect you from any third party action based on your actions.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all laws applicable to you, and not to disrupt or compromise any data beyond what this bug bounty program permits.

Please contact us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy. We reserve the sole right to make the determination of whether a violation of this policy is accidental or in good faith, and proactive contact to us before engaging in any action is a significant factor in that decision. If in doubt, ask us first!
